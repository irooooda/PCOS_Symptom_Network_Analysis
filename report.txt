## üìù Abstract

This project presents a practical and technical pipeline for analyzing symptom relationships in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using network science techniques. Beginning with raw clinical data, we perform cleaning, transformation, co-occurrence analysis, and visualization to uncover potential symptom clusters. These insights may help in identifying PCOS subtypes and improving diagnostic precision. This work was conducted as part of the "Network Science and Telematics" course.

## üìå Introduction

PCOS is a multifaceted condition affecting hormonal levels, metabolism, and reproductive health. Symptoms vary across patients, making standardized diagnosis challenging. This project uses network analysis to map symptom interconnections and reveal community structures that may point to clinical subtypes.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition
Dataset used: **PCOS_data_without_infertility.xlsx**  
Contains clinical information excluding infertility-related cases.

### 2. Configuration
All operational parameters are managed via a centralized **config.yaml**, including:
- File paths
- Data cleaning thresholds
- Visualization settings
- Network filtering rules

### 3. Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled by `data_cleaning.py`, which:
- Drops columns with >50% missing values
- Bins numeric features into 3 categories
- Retains essential features like the PCOS label
- Converts cleaned data into binary format

Outputs:
- `cleaned_pcos_data.csv`
- `binary_transformed_pcos_data.csv`

### 4. Symptom Co-occurrence Matrix
Implemented in `symptom_coocurence.py`, we:
- Count co-occurring symptom pairs
- Construct a co-occurrence matrix
- Export for further analysis

### 5. Network Construction & Analysis
Using `network_utils.py`:
- Nodes = symptoms
- Edges = co-occurrence strength (filtered by threshold)
- Metrics computed: degree centrality, clustering coefficient (0.42)

Community detection: **Louvain algorithm**

### 6. Visualization
`symptom_network_visuals.py` produces:
- Static PNG network (`network_static.png`)
- Interactive HTML graph (`interactive_network.html`)
- Heatmap of symptom co-occurrence (`heatmap.png`)
- Louvain community diagram (`communities.png`)

## üìä Results

- **Total nodes:** 28 symptoms
- **Total edges:** 156 co-occurrences
- **Communities identified:** 3
- **Highest degree centrality:** BMI
- **Clustering coefficient:** 0.42

Visual outputs clearly show groups of symptoms that often appear together, suggesting possible clinical groupings or subtypes.

## üß† Discussion

The generated network helps visualize inter-symptom dynamics in PCOS. Community detection revealed clusters potentially corresponding to metabolic, dermatological, and reproductive symptoms. These findings align with known PCOS subtypes in clinical literature.

Future improvements may include:
- Adding hormone or genetic data
- Applying advanced metrics (betweenness, eigenvector)
- Exploring time-series or dynamic network modeling

---

## üîß Technical Strengths

- Modular Python codebase
- Configurable YAML settings
- Reproducible results and deterministic layout
- Export-friendly for both visual and statistical outputs

---

## üéì Conclusion

This hybrid pipeline combines clinical insight with network science methodology to analyze PCOS symptoms. The process is adaptable for other conditions and is structured for reproducibility, clarity, and further exploration.
